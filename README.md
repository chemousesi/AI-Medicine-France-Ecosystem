**Note 1:** This is not an exhaustive list, and contributions are welcome.

**Note 2:** Good contributions are highly appreciated since one of the main problems for students and young researchers is access to information.

## 1. University Labs

- **CREATIS**: A multidisciplinary laboratory based in Lyon, focused on medical imaging research, with expertise in magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound, X-ray, and optics. CREATIS is a joint research unit (UMR CNRS 5220, Inserm U1294) affiliated with INSA Lyon, Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1, and Université Jean Monnet [Creatis](http://www.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/)

- **CEA Neurospine**: A lab under the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA), focused on neurodegenerative diseases and spinal cord injuries. [CEA Neurospine](https://www.cea.fr/english)

- **MAP5 Descartes**: A mathematics lab under the University of Paris, involved in the development of mathematical methods for AI. [MAP5 Descartes](http://map5.sorbonne-universite.fr/)

- **Lip6**: A computer science lab under Sorbonne University. [Lip6](https://www.lip6.fr/)

- **Inserm**: The French National Institute of Health and Medical Research, with numerous labs across the country. [Inserm](https://www.inserm.fr/en)

- **MIND (Models and Inference for Neuroimaging Data)**: An Inria team, supported by CEA and affiliated with NeuroSpin, focused on research at the intersection of statistics, machine learning, and signal processing to impact neuroscience and neuroimaging research. MIND is a spin-off from the Parietal team and is located in Inria Saclay and CEA Saclay. The team is focused on core methodological developments and application domains such as population modeling, large-scale predictive modeling, mapping cognition and brain networks, and modeling clinical endpoints using multimodal neuroimaging techniques.

- **SODA (Computational and mathematical methods to understand health and society with data)**: An Inria team conducting research at the intersection of machine learning, databases, and quantitative social sciences such as empirical economics and epidemiology. SODA is a spin-off from the Parietal team and is located in Inria Saclay. The team's research axes include table representation learning, data science with statistical learning, health and social sciences, and turn-key machine learning tools for socio-economic impact. [SODA](https://team.inria.fr/soda/)

- **Parietal (Paris-Saclay CDS)**: A joint Inria-CEA team based at the Neurospin research center, focused on learning brain structure, function, and variability from neuroimaging data. The Paris-Saclay Center for Data Science (CDS) develops methods and tools to extract information from big data for multi-disciplinary fields. Parietal is involved in several activities, including RAMP, workshops and training, open-source software development, and various research projects. [Parietal](https://team.inria.fr/parietal/)

- **MLIA - ISIR**: A research team under LIP6, focused on machine learning and AI. [Mlia - Idir Lip6](https://www.isir.upmc.fr/equipes/mlia/)
